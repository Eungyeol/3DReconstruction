The project is motivated by the pipeline of [1]. I started off my establishing keypoint matching using SIFT and the 8-point algorithm,
then I estimate the fundamental matrix as in [2] using Levenberg-Marquardt. I can compute the homography as in [3] and rectify the images
as in [4]. I autocalibrate as in [5] to recover the camera parameters, and then I compute the disparity map using alpha-expansion.
The alpha-expansion parameters are estimated using the EM approach of [6].
